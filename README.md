# Synopsis
This is a simple way of displaying tweets from users on a map. Each line of the dataset we are given, contains the following separated by commas: MESSAGEID, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, MESSAGEDATE, EMOTION.

# Background
This is a very simple Web Application. In the file TweetsDataset, you can find a small dataset of 10.000 tweets. 
We are concentrating at the columns Latitude and Longitude  based on which, we are displaying the tweets on the map.
For this small example we are using the Google Maps JavaScript API v3 and we have modified this code: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/icon-complex.

# Running the project
You can run the example by running the mapjsp.jsp file under a Web Project in Netbeans IDE. You can use the jsp file and the dataset file to your existing Web Project aw well.

Here is a screenshot of the output:
